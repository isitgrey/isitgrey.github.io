                    <p class="text-muted">As announced at the PUARL Conference in San Francisco in October 2016 (PDF download), The University Suor Orsola Benincasa in Naples (UniSOB), offers a Master in Architecture program entitled Building Beauty: Ecologic Design and Construction Process <br> The program proposes an integrated approach to: 1) Direct design and construction; 2) Local, low-tech building techniques; 3) community empowerment. The proposed model process builds on Christopher Alexander’s legacy, looking at international cooperation, right-to-build, emergency and place ecology in an profoundly sustainable perspective.</p>

The course is a residential, intensive program entirely taught in English language, and designed to offer a holistic experience of designing and making, learning about the reality of feelings and an evidence-based approach to the architectural process.</p>
