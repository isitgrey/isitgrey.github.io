              <p>I am in my final semester in Austin Community College's User Experience/User Interface Design program. I'm a versatile designer with skills in UI, UX, and visual design.</p>
              <p>My other interests include just enough understanding of HTML/CSS and prototyping tools to be a little bit dangerous. I always look for tools that can better the relationship between design and development.</p>
      
              <p>Since being exposed to the principles of user-centered design, my world has become a design problem unto itself. I find myself constantly picking at and pulling stuff apart.  In my free time I enjoy reading about emotional intelligence and people watching.</p> 
              <p>I'm obsessed with the Beat Generation â€” from Ralph Steadman's illustrations for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to Allan Ginsberg's Howl. I take respect, humility, and listening to others very seriously. These skills are key elements to help me better solve problems. </p>
