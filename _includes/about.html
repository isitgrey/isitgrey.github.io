              <p>As announced at the PUARL Conference in San Francisco in October 2016 (PDF download), The University Suor Orsola Benincasa in Naples (UniSOB), offers a Master in Architecture program entitled Building Beauty: Ecologic Design and Construction Process</p>
              <p>The program proposes an integrated approach to: 1) Direct design and construction; 2) Local, low-tech building techniques; 3) community empowerment. The proposed model process builds on Christopher Alexanderâ€™s legacy, looking at international cooperation, right-to-build, emergency and place ecology in an profoundly sustainable perspective.</p>
